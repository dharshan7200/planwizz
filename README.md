## 🚀 Overview

**PlanWizz** (SEC-TimeTable) is an advanced and intuitive scheduling system designed to make academic timetable generation effortless. By parsing raw PDF enrollment data and applying advanced CSP algorithms, it ensures zero time clashes while resp;cting both strict requirements and soft preferences.

📄 Demo Enrollment : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VT12qITTInFJmps7ug3HAilQCmZY83rE

## ✨ Key Features

- 📄 **Smart PDF Parsing**: Automatically extracts course information, available slots, and faculty details from structured PDF files.
- 🧠 **Advanced CSP Solver**: Implements a robust backtracking algorithmic engine to find a perfectly valid, clash-free schedule.
- ⚙️ **Context-Aware Design**: Handles hard constraints (like specific leave days) and soft constraints (like preferred faculty or time ranges).
- 🎨 **Responsive UI**: A beautiful, minimalist frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.
- 🔍 **Searchable Course List**: Easily find specific subjects by Name or Course Code in the selection menu.

## 🛠 Project Structure

The repository is modular and split into two core environments:

- 📂 `Springboot/`: Spring Boot 3 + Java 17 application containing all PDF parsing logic and the CSP timetabling engine. (Default/Active backend).
- 📂 `backend/`: Legacy FastAPI application containing all PDF parsing logic and the CSP timetabling engine.
- 📂 `frontend/`: React + Vite web application containing the user interface.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- **Java JDK 17+** and **Maven 3.8+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

Navigate to the `Springboot` directory:

```bash
# Build the application
mvn clean package

# Run the Spring Boot backend server
mvn spring-boot:run
```
> The API will run at `http://localhost:8000`

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
# Enter the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install necessary modules
npm install

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```
> The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`

## ☁️ Deployment (Render)

This project is fully configured for automated deployment securely on [Render](https://render.com).

1. **Create a Render Account**: Sign up at Render Dashboard.
2. **Create a New Blueprint**:
   - Go to **New +** > **Blueprint**.
   - Connect this GitHub repository.
3. **Auto-Configuration**:
   - Render automatically detects the `render.yaml` file in the root directory.
   - It will spin up two services: `planwiz-backend` (FastAPI) and `planwiz-frontend` (React static site).
4. **Deploy**: Click **Apply** to complete the deployment.

*(The frontend automatically detects the deployed backend URL via the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable).*
